# Good Morning
One of the most important job of being a field executive in BSNL is the every morning routine of logging into the ITPC website
and downloading the list of faults and then sorting the list section wise before handing it out to respective section staff for
fault rectification. This can be very tedious at times especially for executives who are in-charge of multiple exchanges. But
the good news is that these kind of routine tasks can be automated and this project attempts to make the life of a BSNL feild 
executive a little easier by automatic some of their morning routines.
